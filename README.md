# Protein-Folding
Monte Carlo Approach to Protein Folding (Hydrophobic-Polar model)

This code is able to generate the images that have been put together in the following illustration. 
The code is a bit messy as it was part of a 3rd-year project where software development good practices were not part of the criteria to grade my work. 

The goal was to simulate protein folding using the HP model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic-polar_protein_folding_model

I hope it is still clear. Enjoy!
